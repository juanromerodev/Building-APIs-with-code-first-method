# Building APIs - Code First Method

Hello everyone! In this lesson, I have gained insights about the "code-first" method, which forms an interesting topic of the .NET Web Services Development course.

## So, what exactly is the code-first method?

The code-first method entails creating classes in our codebase as the initial step. Subsequently, our Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, in this case Entity Framework Core, will generate the database for the project, in this case SQL Server.

In essence, the workflow can be summarized in: 

YOU --> build your code --> ORM --> build your database.
